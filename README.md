## Running the project
Because I'm using FCF you'll need to `cd` into the *functions* folder of your workspace folder i.e. mine is:

`cd C:\Users\lorna.watson\repos\my-apis\functions`

To run locally, fire off `firebase serve` and usually this uses port *5000* (it'll say in the command window anyway).

## What's next?
* Setup MongoDB (for logging purposes i.e. emails)
* Implement testing
* More functionality
* Explore Twilio API more
* Pretty emails
* ...
