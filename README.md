# My APIs

The purpose of this project is to work as a backend service for my portfolio website.

## Tech stack
* Node.js
* Firebase (Cloud Functions) (not free ðŸ˜¢ but wicked ðŸ˜Ž)
* Heruko for hosting (free)

## How to run the project
Because I'm using FCF you'll need to `cd` into the *functions* folder of your workspace folder i.e. mine is:

`cd C:\Users\lorna.watson\repos\my-apis\functions`

To run locally, fire off `firebase serve` and usually this uses port *5000* (it'll say in the command window anyway).
