# My APIs

[![time tracker](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/lornasw93/my-apis.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/lornasw93/my-apis)

I initially was going to have a few Node.js API projects talking with my website i.e. get blogs and get repos, but since have decided to combine the APIs needed into a single project as I want minimal costs.

I will update this README when I've tidied up the code i.e. routes, controllers implemented.
